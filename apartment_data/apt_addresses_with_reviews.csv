2400 Nueces,"2400 Nueces St, Austin, TX 78705",2.4,"[""I lived in a 4x4 at 2400 Nueces in the fall of 2022 and it's a solid apartment.\n\nPros:\n• Proximity to campus. It's literally just like one block away from campus.\n• The interior of the apartment is a little dated, but the furniture provided is still functional.\n• The bed mattress provided was super soft and comfortable.\n• Most units have really nice views from the windows and balcony.\n• Since it's a UT apartment, the residents are generally pretty nice and not too loud. It's not filled with party kids like some other West Campus apartments.\n• The gym is solid for an apartment. It's got a decent variety of workout machines, dumbbells, and a bench press.\n• Any maintenance issues were resolved very quickly (often the same day.)\n• I liked that the key to the apartment is also your UT ID card, so I didn't have to carry another set of keys everywhere with me.\n• The apartment felt safe while also not being overly restrictive like a dorm. It seems that some of the older reviews said that you had to check in with the front desk if you arrived late at night, but that wasn't the case when I stayed there. All you needed to do was scan your ID outside the door if entering after like 10pm.\n• Probably the best pro to the apartment was that if you graduate from UT while living here (or you end up doing study-abroad the next semester), you can actually request to terminate your lease so that you don't have to pay rent for the remaining months. They also pro-rated my rent for the month when I left which was nice. Highly recommend this place if you're a senior.\n• In addition, they also offer a limited set of 9-month contracts if you sign very early in the cycle (like early fall semester of the previous school year). It's a nice option if you don't plan on staying over the summer. The 9-month contracts are also at the same rate as the 12-month contracts.\n\nCons:\n• For a 4x4 with an attached bathroom, my rent was about $1,030 a month. It's not the most expensive place in West Campus, but depending on who you might ask, some might still find it pricey.\n• For being a UT apartment and having direct access to utexas internet, I thought the internet would be good. Sure if you run a speed test, it'll give you like 200-300 Mbps down, but the network itself is just pretty congested and ends up being really slow sometimes. Furthermore, the Ethernet connections would just randomly lose internet for like 5-10 seconds like a couple times a day. Super frustrating.\n• The mail room hours were also kind of annoying. It's not an open-access mail room, so you can only go and get your packages when an RA is present at the mail room. Sometimes, there wouldn't be someone present when the hours said there should. Also, you had to wait an additional 3 hours after a package arrived for them to process it. I guess one benefit is that packages didn't get stolen like other apartments, but it still was a bummer that sometimes you had to wait until the next day to get your package.\n• I think there were a couple phantom fire alarms, but it seems that's a common occurrence at most WC apartments lol.\n\nOverall, it's a nice apartment and I highly recommend staying here if you're graduating because it'll save you some money. It's not as modern-looking as some other apartments, but it's still a solid place."", '2400 Nueces is a bit pricey, but everything was clean and in good condition when my UT student moved in. Maintenance has been responsive to calls. There are terrific views of west campus and the UT Tower. Is this *too* nice for a college student? I resisted the urge to start this review with ""In my day..."" :)', 'I will preface this review by saying that I lived here under the old management for 1.5 years and then this past semester / summer under UT management. The old apartment management was decent enough: the front desk staff were friendly and knew me by name and were always helpful with anything I needed, maintenance orders were carried out quickly enough, and the overall atmosphere was great. It\'s pricey, but it\'s close to campus, has great amenities, and is a great place to live if you can afford it. I would have gladly lived here all 4 years.... but:\n\nThen, UT took over. This past semester has been awful. They basically turned the place into a dorm. You have to show proof you live there to a front desk person if you come in from midnight to 8 AM (inconvenient if you run in the morning). You have to register guests if they are staying overnight. They no longer allow delivery drivers to come straight to your door. In addition, the front desk staff have become extremely rude and condescending. Once, I was threatened with ""disciplinary action from the provost"" because I was questioning the front desk staff about a new policy they suddenly enacted. Worse yet, communication has completely broken down between the management and the tenants. All of the above policy changes come in from one day to the next, with absolutely no warning or prior emails explaining the changes.\n\nThis affects me more personally since I signed my lease under old management, only to be moved into a dorm-like setting one day without any prior knowledge.\n\nHowever, the silver lining is that this is a really nice place to live. The floor plans are solid and the views around the building are breathtaking. My view outside of my balcony is what I will miss most about this place. Also, the walls are SOLID concrete. I have not heard a single sound coming from any of my neighbors during my 2 years here. If you can put up with the BS red tape that UT puts up, this is a really nice place. But, it\'s pricey.\n\nUltimately, UT\'s takeover ruined this apartment building for me. Personally, I want to just write a monthly check out to management and be left alone. UT has denied that to its residents by putting up literal barriers around this apartment building.', 'whatever you do, do NOT live here. The staff is nice but uneducated on their own policies. The rent price is absolutely insane for what you get for your money. Elevators have a 50/50 chance of working. After being told that I could move out early after getting a subleaser in place, they did not return my final rent payment in full (fair) but lacked informing their staff on the specifics of the lease terms once the keys were turned in. Angie Gabriel, manager of resident services would not call me to clarify my questions but rather hid behind her computer screen whenever I had any questions after I asked more than twice I wanted to talk directly. WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT LIVE HERE UNLESS YOU LIKE THROWING YOUR MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN.', 'This is a terrible place to live. The elevators are often broken, normally there would only be one or two elevators working. Good luck getting to class on time when the elevator stops on every single floor on its way down. The sink and toilet are easily clogged and maintenance takes forever. For a rent price of $1,400 a month, this sort of stuff is just ridiculous. I also heard from a friend that the property manager Laura Bales actively discriminated against people with disability by denying the living condition that would offer equal opportunities for the disabled. DO NOT CHOOSE TO LIVE HERE FOR YOUR OWN SAKE!!']"
26 West,"600 W 26th St, Austin, TX 78705",2.8,"[""Compared to other West Campus apartments, this one is fairly nice. Rooms are tolerable and bedroom size is nice, and maintenance happens quickly as long as you remember to submit a request. Every bedroom has a window. Staff is usually kind and efficient.\n\nGym is plentiful and large, it's not Greg sized but it is still good."", 'This community is not worth your money. The staff members, specifically the front desk employees such as Miranda, are unnecessarily rude. I understand having a bad day, but if you dislike your job that isn’t the residents fault. The units are not kept up to standard, many with broken appliances. Constantly dealing with incorrect charges being made on your account, and management is almost never available when needed, or will stay in their office/ignore residents and tell the receptionist to have us come back later (but still not be available). If you can avoid American Campus Communities all together, then do so.', 'Just want to say that Eddie Alvarez (the maintenance guy) is extremely helpful, hardworking, and efficient. He gets everything done on time and is extremely nice. He is amazing at what he does.', 'Be careful when you turn in your keys, make sure you get evidence that you turned everything in. After I gave them all my stuff I got an email saying ""I didn\'t turn in my parking pass"" then they charged $100. The apartment was ok, there\'s better places for the price.', '26 West erroneously sent out late fees to every resigned resident because they did not tell us that our autopay would expire as the new lease began. They sent out an email saying they would waive them if we emailed. However, paying August rent would now incur a $20 transaction fee as it was a ""one-time"" transaction instead of a recurring transaction. To avoid this fee, I called the office and spoke to one of the students, who told me I could pay by check by August 17th.\n\nThree days after they sent out the email, my parents called asking who to make the check out to. They then reversed their position, saying that paying by check was not available. My parents stayed on call for 2 hours with them while I was out and didn\'t have cell service. 26 West denied that any of their employees said that paying by check was possible and said the only options were to pay the one-time transaction fee or get a money order from a bank or store (it was Sunday so banks were closed). They said the rent had to be paid that day or they wouldn\'t waive late fees.\n\nStaff had told me rent had to be paid by August 17th. On August 6, they said rent had to be paid by August 6 and denied ever saying otherwise. The email had no stated deadline either.\n\nPoor management that makes money off their miscommunications.']"
Crest at Pearl,"706 W Martin Luther King Jr Blvd, Austin, TX 78701",4.0,"[""Lived here last year and I the rooms are very spacious and great for the price. The amenities are decent, they have okay gym equipment but they do not have A/C in the study room on the 3rd floor so it does get stuffy but they do have free printing service which was a huge plus. The elevators were broken regularly, sometimes for days or weeks at a time but I really think that's the only huge downside. I think the units are great as I have visited my friends in other units but I definitely would say to try to get a window room, and if you have a windowless room to get some light fixtures and some decor because it can get pretty depressing in there without a window. I think my only complaint for the unit itself would be that their appliances were a bit outdated such as the refrigerator and the washer/dryer but still functional. Lots of cabinet and pantry space in the kitchen. Somewhat dirty floors both in the unit and in general. Exceptionally helpful staff and very quick maintenance/repair team. Garage is decent and they offer a locker package retrieval service for free as well. I would definitely live here again if I got a room with a window."", 'Recently went here for some business, and had a pleasing experience. The elevator wasn’t working when I went, but I think it’s fine jogging up to the 2nd floor. However, I do understand how painful it could be to have to live in one of the higher floors when this happens. The restroom’s in the apartments are also very nice and calming; especially, William’s toilet. Overall, lovely experience, with only some minor annoyances.', 'I stopped by the office on short notice for a tour, and was able to get one immediately. Isaac was a great tour guide; friendly, welcoming, answered all of my questions, and provided me with everything I needed. Seems to be a great place to live, at an exceptional rate. Can’t wait to live here next fall!', 'Apartment is spacious for the price, but very lackluster and the entire building is just gross and musty. Bad security and very easy to get in through the gate. When we moved in the unit was disgusting, nothing had been cleaned. We even had poprocks/rock candy stuck to the inside of our cabinets upon move in. They ""inspect"" the units and charge you a small fortune for cleaning fees but then they do no cleaning whatsoever. Hallways are so ugly and dirty, there are roaches on the stairwells frequently, the elevators break all the time. Sometimes both are broken so if you live on a higher floor that\'s just tough luck.\n\nThey tried to charge me for a dirty bathroom when I hired a maid service through them that guaranteed no cleaning fees. They did credit the money back, but it shows that they just charge you for random cleaning fees regardless of what you do. There\'s no way the bathroom was dirty if I literally hired a maid service, they made that up.\n\nThe apartment is a low-quality build in general, you can hear everything through the walls which is super uncomfortable. The gym is stuffy, hot, and way too small. The treadmills also break all the time so sometimes there would only be one working and I would have to walk to a UT gym to work out. Also, something to consider: this place is right next to the 21st street co-op. They will do drum circles at odd hours of the night, my roommates and I would wake up at 4am sometimes (yes, on week nights as well as weekends) because they will randomly scream or do chants. There were some nights where we couldn\'t sleep for hours because of the noise. Not the apartment\'s fault, but the co-op being next door seriously undervalues this place and in my opinion makes it not worth what it costs to live there.\n\nOther apartments in west campus charge similar prices for better. Don\'t lease here unless you have no other option, easily the worst place I\'ve lived in west campus so far. The cherry on top for me was that when I paid my last cycle of bills (they add up 2-3 months of bills and charge you all at once at the end of summer), they charged a $19.95 processing fee for ANY form of payment. Echeck, credit card, debit card, you name it, when there was never a charge before to pay rent/bills.', 'This complex is so nice. Isaac was extremely helpful with the whole process of touring and signing. He described everything in detail, and answered all my questions effectively. Overall, great place and great staff!']"
GrandMarc,"510 W 26th St, Austin, TX 78705",3.4,"['Rooms are huge and spacious for west campus but apartment amenities and other features are very run down. Apartment community is nice and small.\nCons:\n- Air did not go under 80 degrees in the summer for the first 2 months of moving in. Had to keep requesting maintenance to come back until fixed.\n- Disposal broke\n- Hot water heater broke twice. We went 2 full weeks without hot water\n- Elevator down half the year\n- Inconvenient Construction during the middle of the year that we did not know when signing the lease. They kept water off in our unit for construction all day/overnight when they told us it would be back on at 5pm.\n- Maintenance turned power off in workout room without warning while I was running on it.\n- Apartment floors make your feet black if you walk barefoot no matter how much you clean them.\n- People smoke weed on balcony’s and workers don’t do anything\n- Hallways of complex are filthy as well as the elevators. Once had dog pee in the elevator for 2 straight days\n- Garage gate always broken and is not safe because anyone can get into the garage/apartment\n- Homeless person was found in stairs of apartment\n- Saw a homeless person literally pull the locked doors and they opened.\n- Pool is always moldy and birds dive-bomb you while around pool area. There is also concrete sharp pieces at the bottom of the pool\n-  Package system is inconvenient. The front desk collects them so you have to pick up during office hours.\n-  Walls are very thin and you can hear everything in the complex hallways from inside your apartment\n- Loud parties that workers don’t do anything about\n- Fire alarms randomly go off.', 'Maddy and the rest of the GrandMarc staff have been such a pleasure to work with and get to know! They are very friendly, and more importantly, professional. They have made my first experience with the leasing process outstanding. They are always happy to help and answer any questions in a timely manner. I would highly recommend anyone looking for an apartment to stop by the GrandMarc.', ""Looking for an apartment rental for my son has been a nightmare in west campus, until we found GrandMarc. Andy, the manager, has been a god send from beginning to end: he responds to emails within hours, answers all questions and even attaches pictures and drawings to show us details. During my son's stay, maintenance requests were promptly addressed, there was never any billing errors, and for whatever questions we have, we can always count on a reliable and dedicated property manager/team for clear communication and resolution. Other new build/high rises in the area may have all the bells and whistles and very well rehearsed  initial tour/sales pitch to attract prospective tenants but they were poorly managed, with students RAs answering phone call and provide confusing/no answers to questions, or very commonly - no communications at all.\nGrandMarc - one block from campus; small community; and most importantly excellent management!!"", ""First year for our daughter to stay here at the GrandMarc.\nThe manager and Madelyn were so helpful and kind.\nThey took the time to answer all my questions and concerns.\nWe also dealt with Madelyn as we were booking my daughter's apartment back in the fall and she was so helpful and understanding.\n\nIt is really nice to see that the staff here do understand and support us parents that our children are their number one priority."", ""TW bugs\n\nManagement is nice, but I would say that if you have problems and contact their office, the student employees working there tell you that they would call you back, but they do not. Maintenance is always on time and they're great.\n\nThere are lots and lots of roaches (especially on the 2nd floor). No amount of fumigation, cleaning, and out-of-pocket expenses could get rid of them. The floor is dark which makes it hard to see them. I killed almost 15 roaches within only a few weeks of moving in. The wifi is also super slow.\n\nMy unit’s thermostat stayed super hot during the summer, and even maintenance came in to replace it— but it did not make any difference at all. As a person that tries to save on electricity, I usually spend no more than 50 but there was a huge increase in my bill, and they started charging me 95. I paid a little over 300 for my final utility bill, and there was nothing they could do about it. I lost so much money living here.\n\nIf you have a package delivered and their office is closed, you have to wait until the next day to get it. It is inconvenient especially if it’s important.\n\nOverall, I think it is just the building in general. You can definitely get a better apartment somewhere else in West Campus because their expensive rates and the quality/peace of mind do not go hand in hand.""]"
Inspire on 22nd,"2200 Nueces St, Austin, TX 78705",5.0,"[""I lived at Inspire my third year at UT, and I've just renewed my lease for my fourth and last year in school.

The staff is very friendly, and they are very quick to respond to emails."", 'I have lived at Inspire for seven months now and I renewed my lease for an additional year.  My experience here has been great. The rooms are very soundproof. I never hear my neighbors. Maintenance responds to my work orders on the same day I place them. Management is very nice and helpful. They email and text back and forth very quickly. I toured a lot of apartments before choosing Inspire and I truly think it is some of the best student housing on West Campus.', ""Just got a tour here, so I'm just leaving a review for the staff. Hunter Hodges gave us a fantastic tour! He was so helpful, answered every question we had, and was so sweet!"", 'Had a wonderful tour experience with a wonderful tour guide, Hunter Hodges, he gave us a full amenities and room tour of their show room and was able to answer any questions we had easily.

Ion,"2100 San Antonio St, Austin, TX 78705",3.2,"['I went in to tour the apartment and I was shocked at how poorly the building was taken care of for an Austin high-rise apartment. I saw mold in vents and it was clear that trash was not picked up frequently. Management also seemed very disinterested during the tour. I would advise to go a different direction if you are looking to find a place in West Campus as it is not only very underwhelming, but very pricey too.', 'I am just annoyed that they will not return my multiple phone calls. I guess they do not need anymore new students and paying parents with questions!', ""Great staff! They are super kind and helpful. I was confused about a leasing and other things, and they were honest and helpful about what they could and couldn't do. My only problem is the rooms without windows. They charge $25 for a window room, and as someone without a window room, it can seriously harm your mood. However, the apartments themselves are top quality and at an affordable price if you sign the lease early."", 'I really enjoyed living at ion, the amenities were great and I liked the community! The rooms were a little smaller than expected and some elevators sometimes broke down, but overall I had a great experience. MAGGIE was the nicest member on staff and was always there to get packages or just have a fun convo on the way out! Give her a raise!!!!!', ""Incredible team that goes above and beyond for residents (especially Ryan Rico). I have a lease for the upcoming academic year, which begins in late August. A few weeks ago, I accepted an an internship that would require me to reside in Austin for the summer. I found a resident willing to sublease their unit. Not only did the management team make the lease delegation process very simple and painless, they made it so I could stay during the August transfer period (nearly all leases in West Campus end in late July). Great service for a unique circumstance and the management team exceeded my expectations. Excited to move in!\n\nIn addition, while touring apartments last fall, the Ion team stood out. Ion's tour was painless and the leasing agents were not pushy at all. They spoke honestly about advantages and flaws to the building.  It felt like we were talking to real humans. The incredible service I received during the subletting process confirmed that the management team is great for residents, even after you sign your lease.\n\nNot only that, Ion's contract is short and more fair than other West Campus housing. The listed price is more expensive, but having minimal hidden fees make a difference. Small delegation fees, no application fee, and utilities included in a flat amenities fee.""]"

At the beginning of the fall 22 semester when everyone moved in, the trash chutes were closed for 3 weeks. Residents were instructed to take their trash to the dumpster in the alley behind the building, but of course a lot didn’t, so there was trash lining the hot hallways for days at a time.

We found tiny beetles crawling everywhere in our apartment, in the sink, bathtub, the walls, the floor, in our beds, on our pillows, on our clothes in the closet, crawling on hair ties. Keep in mind our apartment is incredibly clean, and the pest control assessment mentioned that the bugs are a result of the apartment's constant humidity problem. When we begged management for help and living accommodations until pest control could fumigate, they said there was nothing they could do and they didn't consider it an emergency. When I told my UT professor about this problem, even she asked for the management and building name so she could try to get us accommodations. After telling us the problem would be handled, the building management stopped answering when we asked for updates on when the apartment would be fumigated, and truly didn't show any concern for resolving the problem as soon as possible; in the middle of finals week. The lack of communication or care is terrifying. All they kept saying was that our last work order for the problem was in October, and completely missed the point that the bug problem had gotten out of control and was now an emergency that needed to be dealt with immediately. The pest control company that came to our apartment TWO days after our emergency work order told us they would need to prepare the apartment for fumigation, but our apartment complex has completely stopped communicating with us about the problem and we have had to find sleeping arrangements ourselves, which for most of us is driving home three hours away and taking an INCOMPLETE on our FINALS. We still don't know what is going on or when we will be able to go back to living in our apartment.

It is very clear as soon as you walk into the units that the humidity level is far higher than what it should be. Our sheets are damp and the moisture in the air is tangible. Perhaps I have just been unlucky with my two different units, but after speaking to other residents here at the Nine, I know that my roommates and I are not the only ones with humidity issues. At the beginning of the year, even the maintenance worker told me that the humidity was a pervasive issue throughout the building.\n\nHumidity itself may not be a large enough problem, but the mold and bugs that come with the humidity are. As seen in other reviews, there are entire units that are infested with mold and bugs that are likely not isolated cases.\n\nIf you try to raise your concerns with management, they will blame the humidity on plants (that my first apartment didn't have) or any other excuse that they can bring up so that they can do less than the bare minimum of giving their residents a bearable living situation.\n\nSave yourself the worry and the trouble and find another place to live."", 'Worst place to stay if you’re a student.

For half the year my shower was hot for about 5 min then it would turn freezing cold and they couldn’t do much about it. Maintenance was 5 stars though because he always did his best! AC was also weird for half the year and we’d set it to about 75 and it would be humid in the apartment and you’d have to put it up to 73 for it to be cool inside and that is just a lot in the electrical bill. I also had mold in certain parts of my shower when I moved in and found out I had pink mold further in the year (very mild but still concerning). The shower extractor is the lowest power ever and that’s how all of them are as far as the apartment I was in so it didn’t do much to take away the humidity after a shower. They don’t really check if the stovetop is properly cleaned because when I cleaned it and lifted up the top there was so much gunk at the bottom and was truly nasty.

Signature,"1909 Rio Grande St, Austin, TX 78705",2.8,"[""I don't often write reviews, but I felt that I needed to thank everyone at Signature for providing a safe and comfortable place for my daughter to live while attending UT. The staff goes above and beyond... from move in day, to move out day and every day in-between. My daughter loved the location of her apartment. The several times I came to visit, it felt like a fun place to live with many amenities (gym, pool, study pods). Everything was clean, including the elevators and parking garage. My daughter especially loved the variety of events the staff puts together  (happy hour, contests, first day of school pictures) I can not thank you enough for the peace of mind knowing my daughter was happy and safe! She made wonderful memories living there. I highly recommend this apartment to anyone!"", 'Extremely Disappointed with Signature Apartments\nI regret to say that my experience living at Signature Apartments has been nothing short of disappointing. I feel compelled to share my grievances in the hope that others may avoid the same issues I encountered during my time there.\nFirst and foremost, our move-in day was an absolute nightmare. Upon arrival, we were greeted with an apartment that was far from the ""clean, empty"" space we were promised. Instead, we were welcomed by a mess left behind by the previous residents, including garbage strewn about, filthy walls with noticeable divots, and dust lurking in every air vent. To make matters worse, we were forced to hire a cleaning service at our own expense just to make the apartment habitable. This was an immediate breach of our contract and a clear indication of a lack of responsibility on the part of Signature Apartments.\nOur problems didn\'t end there. For over a month and a half, we had to deal with a malfunctioning fridge that froze all our groceries. The ordeal involved numerous back-and-forths with management, particularly Candice Stricklin. At first, they absurdly suggested that we were storing our items incorrectly. However, it\'s common knowledge that regardless of how one arranges their groceries, they should not turn into frozen blocks. We followed their advice and adjusted the settings accordingly, but the issue persisted. After much insistence, they finally replaced the fridge with a so-called ""new"" one, which inexplicably lacked an ice machine and was handed over to us in a filthy state. This was particularly frustrating as we, being college students on tight budgets, had spent a significant amount on groceries that had gone to waste due to the initial faulty appliance.\nFurthermore, the apartment itself left much to be desired. It lacked natural light, giving it a dark and claustrophobic feel. Out of the four bedrooms, only two had windows. I was unlucky enough to have a room with a view of the Torre parking garage in the alleyway, which meant keeping the blinds drawn at all times to avoid the unsightly view.\nAs if these issues weren\'t enough, the general condition of the apartment building left much to be desired. The trash chute was consistently overflowing, resulting in a persistent stench of garbage throughout the building. The rent, which is already exorbitant for what is offered, is further compounded by a $145 monthly parking fee. To add insult to injury, the mandatory use of SimpleBills, a third-party utility payment service, felt like a total scam.\nI would strongly advise against considering Signature Apartments as your place of residence. The numerous issues I\'ve encountered, from the unclean move-in conditions to the inadequate appliances and overall lackluster living environment, make it clear that this establishment falls far short of its promises and fails to provide the value one would expect for the price. Save yourself the frustration and look elsewhere for a more suitable place to call home.', ""I'm going to miss this place so much.  Spent my last 2 years at UT here, made great friends and the staff was always so helpful and seemed like they actually cared.  I had a pretty bad experience with another wampus apartment before but Signature actually tries to help you out most of the time.  Would highly recommend, won't find anything better at UT."", 'I think it’s funny this building calls itself luxurious. All the furnishings inside the apartment look like they came from a discount store. The pool is dirty. The staff doesn’t even make eye contact with you when you walk by, let alone say hello. The other day I was working downstairs in the lobby and overheard a female staff member take a call from a disgruntled tenant. She laughed with her coworkers about how the caller told her the staff here has no heart and doesn’t care. He was right.', 'Like many have noted, Signature will try to charge you once you move out for unreasonable things, and they are unwilling to properly evaluate any disputes because of their greed. I was charged $35 because the bathtub was ""dirty"", even though the picture they used as proof is shadowy, and does not indicate anything beyond normal wear and tear (attached below). The process to have your disputes considered takes a long time, requires many emails, and feels entirely pointless because of their lack of willingness to waive/reduce charges even when unfair. I\'m thoroughly frustrated and unhappy with them.']"

I was under the impression that my unit would be furnished and requested it to be, but this wasn’t communicated as there was a change with management right when the school semester started, and I paid for a “furnished room” to get one twin mattress in my room and had to live with that for two weeks before I ordered furniture during the hectic start of the school year. In the contract they state they will replace your garage key but for a fee if lost but I they have been unable to replace it, making me have to wait outside the garage for someone to come in for the past like 3 months - such a waste of gas and time. Our dryer turns off every 5 minutes so it has to be rerun so it is like a 6 hour task to get laundry done, and the office hasn’t resolved this issue either. The only person who is pleasing to speak with is the person doing the actual repairs for maintenance (thank you Javier) and the rest of the office staff is honestly just rude and doesn’t show you the slightest respect. The property overall definitely needs some renovation as the appliances are old - the ONE elevator we have broke like every other week at one point.', 'Do not live here. The management is absolutely terrible, they don’t care at all about their residents or their well being. The entire building is disgustingly filthy, the amenities only work half of the time if at all. The management is impossible to get ahold of, and once you finally do they’re absolutely no help. It’s absolutely not worth the price.']"
Villas on Rio,"2111 Rio Grande St, Austin, TX 78705",3.8,"['pictured here is the view from my living room ""window."" I leased from 2022/2023, and lived with little to no sunlight because I also happened to have a windowless room (which are now ILLEGAL for these massive apartment complexes in the city of Austin to build by the way). My roommates and I celebrated when a single sliver of sunlight would come into our living room between 6:07 and 6:15 pm. I was given ZERO warning that our window was going to face a massive brick concrete wall that was two feet away, and ZERO financial compensation for it. We were all still paying the same amount that someone in a D1 floor plan with a BEAUTIFUL view of the city was paying. DO NOT SIGN HERE. They WILL withhold information like this, and they do not allow tours of your specific unit nor do they have a sample room to show despite having a capacity of 600 residents. The in-apartment amenities were nice except for the consistent lack of sunlight that human beings typically need to y\'know live comfortably. I also still had to pay nearly 200 dollars per month for a ""secure"" parking spot despite the gate being wide open and accessible to literally anyone for 9 out of 12 of my months living at Villas on Rio. The residents at Villas were generally rude and standoffish as well; I can recall SO many instances of someone dropping something and people just watching them instead of offering to help as they scramble to pick their stuff up, people don\'t hold open the elevator for someone rushing towards the door, they don\'t offer to hold a door open for someone (college aged OR elderly) carrying something heavy. In short, the residents generally had a noticeable lack of basic manners. The staff were some of the only exceptions to this which I was thankful for. I had a really lackluster experience here and I recommend looking elsewhere in West Campus for a far better living experience. You know it\'s bad when I\'m celebrating and grateful to see SUNLIGHT out of a WINDOW at my new apartment.', 'Villas on Rio has been great. It feels very safe and is great distance to campus. The building is kept clean and functional. The amenities are great and easily accessible. If there are any issues residents are informed.  Living in the pods is actually spacious and private for a better price than others in West Campus. Overall my experience has been good and I plan to renew.', 'Love Villas on Rio so far! The staff was very helpful when me and my roommate signed last year. They were willing to work with us and our preferences (even though we signed kind of late). The amenities are great and clean. I love my room! I have already resigned for next year and can’t wait to live here again.', 'Absolutely love Villas on Rio! Not only is everyone so nice, caring, and understanding, but the location is amazing. Right in the middle of West Campus commuting to and from classes is super easy. The apartment does an extremely good job of giving residents an opportunity to feel like a tight-knit community. In addition, Villas on Rio has by far the best staff. Anything from a  huge maintenance request to answering questions Villas on Rio is on it.', 'I really like this apartment! Amenities are great and I use them everyday, and being next to a Starbucks is nice. Also management is great and they’re super flexible and helpful when you have questions. Maintenance is also great and respond in a timely manner. I like this apartment I just don’t like west campus due to the immense amount of people that live over here.']"
Waterloo,"2400 Seton Ave, Austin, TX 78705",3.2,"['It was fine but just that. The elevators never worked and our pool was closed for months at a time and the hot tub only worked for one month. The actual space was very nice just poorly kept. They didn’t do a very good job with security either, anyone would walk in and try to use our amenities. Rooms are small and walls are thin too. However it is a brand new build so it’s nice to have updated appliances. Overall I’d say the good and the bad cancel each other out and it’s a fine place to live.', 'Having lived in this apartment complex last year, I can say the only positive aspects are the views and diligent maintenance. While maintenance was consistently prompt and efficient in addressing issues, the drawbacks significantly overshadow the few commendable features.\n\nThe biggest letdown was the unreliability of promised amenities. The elevators were frequently broken, forcing us to trek up to our room on the 28th floor numerous times. The hot tub was broken for half the time we lived here, and the so-called spin studio, which was supposed to feature Peloton bikes, not only lacked Pelotons, but the equipment didn\'t work. The ""luxurious rooftop pool"" was inaccessible for over a month due to ongoing ""repairs."" Additionally, I encountered many issues with my key fob, resulting in multiple visits to the office to obtain a replacement. The purportedly ""exclusive residents-only"" coffee shop often became crowded with non-residents, leaving little space for actual residents. The rooms themselves were disappointingly small, with paper-thin walls. While the appliances in the units were of good quality, this was a minor consolation when looking at the big picture.\n\nDon\'t fall for any of the leasing specials you\'re offered. We were enticed with a $200 gift card offer for signing a lease during our tour, but despite our persistent follow-ups, we never received the promised gift card. Also, be extremely cautious when cleaning your room for move-out. Despite thoroughly cleaning my room, I was unexpectedly charged $300 in ""damage"" fees upon leaving, and the same for my roommates, leaving our grand total of ""damage"" charges over $1,000.\n\nIn summary, I would not recommend living in this apartment complex if you seek an enjoyable living experience. There are undoubtedly superior housing options available in West Campus that offer better value and more reliable amenities.', ""The apartment is good on paper, but in practice it hasn't been great. The lobby is stunning and definitely draws you in, but only when it's actually clean. There is very little effort to keep the building cared for unless absolutely necessary, even then it takes time (For instance, someone spilled and left a chik fila milkshake in the elevator, where it rolled around and coated the entire floor. It was like that for several days). It is not rare to see trash spilling out of the bins in the lobby, or enter the lobby bathrooms to complete atrocities.\nTHE TRASH SHOOT. It doesnt work! It won't open. It hasn't since move in. There were times when you couldn't even get into the trash room because the room was stuffed full of garbage, and was spilling into the hall.\nRecycling doesn't work either. There is one little bin in the room other than the broken shoot, and I am highly skeptical that anything actually gets recycled.\n\nTheir is basically no management present, just leasing agents who tend to not know much about anything (Another example, I was having trouble with the wifi in my room for my computer. The ethernet wasn't working. I went to go file some sort of complaint because the maintenance page didn't have ethernet as an option to report, and ended up having to explain what an ethernet cable was). I don't really blame the individuals, but rather whoever trained them because they come across as unaware, and relatively reluctant to help. I've also been in the leasing office when they are receiving phone calls, and have WATCHED these people literally mute the call.This communicated to me just how much the apartment cares about its residents.\n\nAll of these things, though extremely irritating, wouldn't have been that big of a deal if rent wasn't as atrocious as it is. (I live in a 4x4. My room has no windows, and is barely large enough for me to walk in.) There shouldn't be an excuse for this level of laziness if we are paying this much PER PERSON to live in a space that is uncared for, and lacks community."", 'I would like to write a review to give a huge shoutout to Waterloo staff, specifically Laura, who has been a huge help for me during a tedious living arrangement process. Laura has been so helpful- she has answered all my questions within a timely manner, always has a great attitude, and overall has helped me look through solutions within the last few months due to living arrangement changes I have been experiencing. Maddie has also been great, and super helpful. This has made my living experience a lot more enjoyable, because it is nice to have a staff who is willing to help out :-)\n\nIf you are experiencing any trouble, I would recommend contacting Laura. She truly has been so amazing and so helpful throughout this semester. Thank you Laura!', 'The staff here is so friendly and helpful! They remember you by name and Sydney is always so welcoming and kind. Definitely would recommend living at Waterloo.']"

Ion,"2100 San Antonio St, Austin, TX 78705, United States",3.2,"['I went in to tour the apartment and I was shocked at how poorly the building was taken care of for an Austin high-rise apartment. I saw mold in vents and it was clear that trash was not picked up frequently. Management also seemed very disinterested during the tour. I would advise to go a different direction if you are looking to find a place in West Campus as it is not only very underwhelming, but very pricey too.', 'I am just annoyed that they will not return my multiple phone calls. I guess they do not need anymore new students and paying parents with questions!', ""Great staff! They are super kind and helpful. I was confused about a leasing and other things, and they were honest and helpful about what they could and couldn't do. My only problem is the rooms without windows. They charge $25 for a window room, and as someone without a window room, it can seriously harm your mood. However, the apartments themselves are top quality and at an affordable price if you sign the lease early."", 'I really enjoyed living at ion, the amenities were great and I liked the community! The rooms were a little smaller than expected and some elevators sometimes broke down, but overall I had a great experience. MAGGIE was the nicest member on staff and was always there to get packages or just have a fun convo on the way out! Give her a raise!!!!!', ""Incredible team that goes above and beyond for residents (especially Ryan Rico). I have a lease for the upcoming academic year, which begins in late August. A few weeks ago, I accepted an an internship that would require me to reside in Austin for the summer. I found a resident willing to sublease their unit. Not only did the management team make the lease delegation process very simple and painless, they made it so I could stay during the August transfer period (nearly all leases in West Campus end in late July). Great service for a unique circumstance and the management team exceeded my expectations. Excited to move in!\n\nIn addition, while touring apartments last fall, the Ion team stood out. Ion's tour was painless and the leasing agents were not pushy at all. They spoke honestly about advantages and flaws to the building.  It felt like we were talking to real humans. The incredible service I received during the subletting process confirmed that the management team is great for residents, even after you sign your lease.\n\nNot only that, Ion's contract is short and more fair than other West Campus housing. The listed price is more expensive, but having minimal hidden fees make a difference. Small delegation fees, no application fee, and utilities included in a flat amenities fee.""]"

My daughter's room looks like an escape room where you have to strategically move otherwise will end up hurting yourself. Only storage space is a small closet which is a joke, looks more like a broom closet. You cannot even place a basic study table or chair in the room and move around. Have to move the furniture if you want to actually use the bathroom or the door will hit the furniture. Fun part is you pay the same high rent as the other person who has almost twice the space and a walk-in closet. Could they not use common sense when designing the space.

The building is increasingly getting dirtier as the time passes and there is trash that has been left in the same areas for about a month. The trash chute is always locked and never available for use. The trash gets piled high to the ceilings in the trash room leaving the trash room disgusting. I’ve definitely used the trash chute when another trash bag has been going down the chute but it’s still consistently locked out. So residents have no other option but to pile and stuff trash bags into the trash room. Nothing is ever cleaned. Maybe only the first floor and lobby. There’s been vomit all over the place and just general nasty stuff everywhere.  A work order shouldn’t have to be placed for general cleanliness. The response to taco night says they have a cleaning person that rotates floors. This is a 17 story building that would need a crew to clean. One person would not be able to keep up with the all of this and trash left all over.', 'Signing here is a smooth and easy process.

Residents were instructed to take their trash to the dumpster in the alley behind the building, but of course a lot didn’t, so there was trash lining the hot hallways for days at a time.

The staff goes above and beyond... from move in day, to move out day and every day in-between. My daughter loved the location of her apartment. The several times I came to visit, it felt like a fun place to live with many amenities (gym, pool, study pods). Everything was clean, including the elevators and parking garage. My daughter especially loved the variety of events the staff puts together  (happy hour, contests, first day of school pictures) I can not thank you enough for the peace of mind knowing my daughter was happy and safe! She made wonderful memories living there. I highly recommend this apartment to anyone!"", 'Extremely Disappointed with Signature Apartments\nI regret to say that my experience living at Signature Apartments has been nothing short of disappointing. I feel compelled to share my grievances in the hope that others may avoid the same issues I encountered during my time there.\nFirst and foremost, our move-in day was an absolute nightmare. Upon arrival, we were greeted with an apartment that was far from the ""clean, empty"" space we were promised. Instead, we were welcomed by a mess left behind by the previous residents, including garbage strewn about, filthy walls with noticeable divots, and dust lurking in every air vent. To make matters worse, we were forced to hire a cleaning service at our own expense just to make the apartment habitable. This was an immediate breach of our contract and a clear indication of a lack of responsibility on the part of Signature Apartments.\nOur problems didn\'t end there. For over a month and a half, we had to deal with a malfunctioning fridge that froze all our groceries. The ordeal involved numerous back-and-forths with management, particularly Candice Stricklin. At first, they absurdly suggested that we were storing our items incorrectly. However, it\'s common knowledge that regardless of how one arranges their groceries, they should not turn into frozen blocks. We followed their advice and adjusted the settings accordingly, but the issue persisted. After much insistence, they finally replaced the fridge with a so-called ""new"" one, which inexplicably lacked an ice machine and was handed over to us in a filthy state. This was particularly frustrating as we, being college students on tight budgets, had spent a significant amount on groceries that had gone to waste due to the initial faulty appliance.\nFurthermore, the apartment itself left much to be desired. It lacked natural light, giving it a dark and claustrophobic feel. Out of the four bedrooms, only two had windows. I was unlucky enough to have a room with a view of the Torre parking garage in the alleyway, which meant keeping the blinds drawn at all times to avoid the unsightly view.\nAs if these issues weren\'t enough, the general condition of the apartment building left much to be desired. The trash chute was consistently overflowing, resulting in a persistent stench of garbage throughout the building. The rent, which is already exorbitant for what is offered, is further compounded by a $145 monthly parking fee. To add insult to injury, the mandatory use of SimpleBills, a third-party utility payment service, felt like a total scam.\nI would strongly advise against considering Signature Apartments as your place of residence. The numerous issues I\'ve encountered, from the unclean move-in conditions to the inadequate appliances and overall lackluster living environment, make it clear that this establishment falls far short of its promises and fails to provide the value one would expect for the price. Save yourself the frustration and look elsewhere for a more suitable place to call home.', ""I'm going to miss this place so much.  Spent my last 2 years at UT here, made great friends and the staff was always so helpful and seemed like they actually cared.  I had a pretty bad experience with another wampus apartment before but Signature actually tries to help you out most of the time.  Would highly recommend, won't find anything better at UT."", 'I think it’s funny this building calls itself luxurious. All the furnishings inside the apartment look like they came from a discount store. The pool is dirty. The staff doesn’t even make eye contact with you when you walk by, let alone say hello. The other day I was working downstairs in the lobby and overheard a female staff member take a call from a disgruntled tenant. She laughed with her coworkers about how the caller told her the staff here has no heart and doesn’t care. He was right.', 'Like many have noted, Signature will try to charge you once you move out for unreasonable things, and they are unwilling to properly evaluate any disputes because of their greed. I was charged $35 because the bathtub was ""dirty"", even though the picture they used as proof is shadowy, and does not indicate anything beyond normal wear and tear (attached below). The process to have your disputes considered takes a long time, requires many emails, and feels entirely pointless because of their lack of willingness to waive/reduce charges even when unfair. I\'m thoroughly frustrated and unhappy with them.']"
2400 Nueces,"2400 Nueces St, Austin, TX 78705, United States",2.4,"[""I lived in a 4x4 at 2400 Nueces in the fall of 2022 and it's a solid apartment.\n\nPros:\n• Proximity to campus. It's literally just like one block away from campus.\n• The interior of the apartment is a little dated, but the furniture provided is still functional.\n• The bed mattress provided was super soft and comfortable.\n• Most units have really nice views from the windows and balcony.\n• Since it's a UT apartment, the residents are generally pretty nice and not too loud. It's not filled with party kids like some other West Campus apartments.\n• The gym is solid for an apartment. It's got a decent variety of workout machines, dumbbells, and a bench press.\n• Any maintenance issues were resolved very quickly (often the same day.)\n• I liked that the key to the apartment is also your UT ID card, so I didn't have to carry another set of keys everywhere with me.\n• The apartment felt safe while also not being overly restrictive like a dorm. It seems that some of the older reviews said that you had to check in with the front desk if you arrived late at night, but that wasn't the case when I stayed there. All you needed to do was scan your ID outside the door if entering after like 10pm.\n• Probably the best pro to the apartment was that if you graduate from UT while living here (or you end up doing study-abroad the next semester), you can actually request to terminate your lease so that you don't have to pay rent for the remaining months. They also pro-rated my rent for the month when I left which was nice. Highly recommend this place if you're a senior.\n• In addition, they also offer a limited set of 9-month contracts if you sign very early in the cycle (like early fall semester of the previous school year). It's a nice option if you don't plan on staying over the summer. The 9-month contracts are also at the same rate as the 12-month contracts.\n\nCons:\n• For a 4x4 with an attached bathroom, my rent was about $1,030 a month. It's not the most expensive place in West Campus, but depending on who you might ask, some might still find it pricey.\n• For being a UT apartment and having direct access to utexas internet, I thought the internet would be good. Sure if you run a speed test, it'll give you like 200-300 Mbps down, but the network itself is just pretty congested and ends up being really slow sometimes. Furthermore, the Ethernet connections would just randomly lose internet for like 5-10 seconds like a couple times a day. Super frustrating.\n• The mail room hours were also kind of annoying. It's not an open-access mail room, so you can only go and get your packages when an RA is present at the mail room. Sometimes, there wouldn't be someone present when the hours said there should. Also, you had to wait an additional 3 hours after a package arrived for them to process it. I guess one benefit is that packages didn't get stolen like other apartments, but it still was a bummer that sometimes you had to wait until the next day to get your package.\n• I think there were a couple phantom fire alarms, but it seems that's a common occurrence at most WC apartments lol.\n\nOverall, it's a nice apartment and I highly recommend staying here if you're graduating because it'll save you some money. It's not as modern-looking as some other apartments, but it's still a solid place."", '2400 Nueces is a bit pricey, but everything was clean and in good condition when my UT student moved in.

I resisted the urge to start this review with ""In my day..."" :)', 'I will preface this review by saying that I lived here under the old management for 1.5 years and then this past semester / summer under UT management. The old apartment management was decent enough: the front desk staff were friendly and knew me by name and were always helpful with anything I needed, maintenance orders were carried out quickly enough, and the overall atmosphere was great. It\'s pricey, but it\'s close to campus, has great amenities, and is a great place to live if you can afford it. I would have gladly lived here all 4 years.... but:\n\nThen, UT took over. This past semester has been awful. They basically turned the place into a dorm. You have to show proof you live there to a front desk person if you come in from midnight to 8 AM (inconvenient if you run in the morning). You have to register guests if they are staying overnight. They no longer allow delivery drivers to come straight to your door. In addition, the front desk staff have become extremely rude and condescending. Once, I was threatened with ""disciplinary action from the provost"" because I was questioning the front desk staff about a new policy they suddenly enacted. Worse yet, communication has completely broken down between the management and the tenants. All of the above policy changes come in from one day to the next, with absolutely no warning or prior emails explaining the changes.\n\nThis affects me more personally since I signed my lease under old management, only to be moved into a dorm-like setting one day without any prior knowledge.\n\nHowever, the silver lining is that this is a really nice place to live. The floor plans are solid and the views around the building are breathtaking. My view outside of my balcony is what I will miss most about this place. Also, the walls are SOLID concrete. I have not heard a single sound coming from any of my neighbors during my 2 years here. If you can put up with the BS red tape that UT puts up, this is a really nice place. But, it\'s pricey.\n\nUltimately, UT\'s takeover ruined this apartment building for me. Personally, I want to just write a monthly check out to management and be left alone. UT has denied that to its residents by putting up literal barriers around this apartment building.', 'whatever you do, do NOT live here. The staff is nice but uneducated on their own policies. The rent price is absolutely insane for what you get for your money. Elevators have a 50/50 chance of working. After being told that I could move out early after getting a subleaser in place, they did not return my final rent payment in full (fair) but lacked informing their staff on the specifics of the lease terms once the keys were turned in. Angie Gabriel, manager of resident services would not call me to clarify my questions but rather hid behind her computer screen whenever I had any questions after I asked more than twice I wanted to talk directly. WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT LIVE HERE UNLESS YOU LIKE THROWING YOUR MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN.', 'This is a terrible place to live. The elevators are often broken, normally there would only be one or two elevators working. Good luck getting to class on time when the elevator stops on every single floor on its way down. The sink and toilet are easily clogged and maintenance takes forever. For a rent price of $1,400 a month, this sort of stuff is just ridiculous. I also heard from a friend that the property manager Laura Bales actively discriminated against people with disability by denying the living condition that would offer equal opportunities for the disabled. DO NOT CHOOSE TO LIVE HERE FOR YOUR OWN SAKE!!']"

When we begged management for help and living accommodations until pest control could fumigate, they said there was nothing they could do and they didn't consider it an emergency. When I told my UT professor about this problem, even she asked for the management and building name so she could try to get us accommodations. After telling us the problem would be handled, the building management stopped answering when we asked for updates on when the apartment would be fumigated, and truly didn't show any concern for resolving the problem as soon as possible; in the middle of finals week. The lack of communication or care is terrifying. All they kept saying was that our last work order for the problem was in October, and completely missed the point that the bug problem had gotten out of control and was now an emergency that needed to be dealt with immediately. The pest control company that came to our apartment TWO days after our emergency work order told us they would need to prepare the apartment for fumigation, but our apartment complex has completely stopped communicating with us about the problem and we have had to find sleeping arrangements ourselves, which for most of us is driving home three hours away and taking an INCOMPLETE on our FINALS. We still don't know what is going on or when we will be able to go back to living in our apartment. The timeline on this entire process has been excruciating and we have cried too many times to count. Unless you want to be stranded, sleep deprived, and have bugs crawling all over your bed and clothes in the middle of finals week, do not live here!!!!"", ""To any future residents: I would advise looking elsewhere for housing. Regardless of the complete disrespect and lack of communication shown by management, the building has fundamental infrastructure issues that will lead to problems that you will not face in other apartment buildings in West Campus.\n\nThe entire building has a humidity issue; as a resident of two years, I have experienced extreme humidity in both of my apartments that were not solved even with industrial grade dehumidifiers running for days. It is very clear as soon as you walk into the units that the humidity level is far higher than what it should be. Our sheets are damp and the moisture in the air is tangible. Perhaps I have just been unlucky with my two different units, but after speaking to other residents here at the Nine, I know that my roommates and I are not the only ones with humidity issues. At the beginning of the year, even the maintenance worker told me that the humidity was a pervasive issue throughout the building.\n\nHumidity itself may not be a large enough problem, but the mold and bugs that come with the humidity are. As seen in other reviews, there are entire units that are infested with mold and bugs that are likely not isolated cases.\n\nIf you try to raise your concerns with management, they will blame the humidity on plants (that my first apartment didn't have) or any other excuse that they can bring up so that they can do less than the bare minimum of giving their residents a bearable living situation.\n\nSave yourself the worry and the trouble and find another place to live."", 'Worst place to stay if you’re a student. Do not stay here. My friend recently got his car towed because the apartment refused to give him his parking pass that he paid $200 for and they also refused to pay or help  with covering towing fees.

The building won’t fine them or take out the trash at the bottom of the chute frequently enough so it’s just been piling up. On top of that, we’ve had drunk groups of guys bang on our doors at night and scream. It just seems like building management doesn’t care and the apartment doesn’t feel safe if you’re a group of girls alone in your apartment at night. There’s security cameras everywhere and they hire security at night, so I’m not really sure why they keep asking residents who are affected to investigate these guys themselves. The management is ridiculously hard to get in contact with and you can assume that every good review here is fake and/or through them giving residents free gifts or perks for writing a 5 star one.', 'Amazing views, cool pool, and friendly staff.

We pay a LOT of money for this place, and they cannot even staff the office with someone who can take a phone call and answer simple question.

Pointe on Rio,"1901 Rio Grande St, Austin, TX 78705, United States",4.4,"['Didn’t really enjoy living here. I never got actual sunlight and I struggle with mental health so it just wasn’t the place for me because of the lack of sunlight (depends on what floor plan if you get real sunlight in your room). They don’t seem to clean properly before you move in. There was lots of lent all in the back of the dyer and that’s just a fire hazard. For half the year my shower was hot for about 5 min then it would turn freezing cold and they couldn’t do much about it. Maintenance was 5 stars though because he always did his best! AC was also weird for half the year and we’d set it to about 75 and it would be humid in the apartment and you’d have to put it up to 73 for it to be cool inside and that is just a lot in the electrical bill. I also had mold in certain parts of my shower when I moved in and found out I had pink mold further in the year (very mild but still concerning). The shower extractor is the lowest power ever and that’s how all of them are as far as the apartment I was in so it didn’t do much to take away the humidity after a shower. They don’t really check if the stovetop is properly cleaned because when I cleaned it and lifted up the top there was so much gunk at the bottom and was truly nasty. There are just better places in west campus who do so many more activities for their residence for about the same price of rent.\nOh and if one of your roommates has unregistered pets they don’t do much about it. The only reason this was an issue was because there was 4 cats and my apartment constantly smelled of cat poop and just cat in general.', 'Great atmosphere, great location.

Villas on Rio,"2111 Rio Grande St, Austin, TX 78705, United States",3.8,"['pictured here is the view from my living room ""window."" I leased from 2022/2023, and lived with little to no sunlight because I also happened to have a windowless room (which are now ILLEGAL for these massive apartment complexes in the city of Austin to build by the way). My roommates and I celebrated when a single sliver of sunlight would come into our living room between 6:07 and 6:15 pm. I was given ZERO warning that our window was going to face a massive brick concrete wall that was two feet away, and ZERO financial compensation for it. We were all still paying the same amount that someone in a D1 floor plan with a BEAUTIFUL view of the city was paying. DO NOT SIGN HERE. They WILL withhold information like this, and they do not allow tours of your specific unit nor do they have a sample room to show despite having a capacity of 600 residents. The in-apartment amenities were nice except for the consistent lack of sunlight that human beings typically need to y\'know live comfortably. I also still had to pay nearly 200 dollars per month for a ""secure"" parking spot despite the gate being wide open and accessible to literally anyone for 9 out of 12 of my months living at Villas on Rio. The residents at Villas were generally rude and standoffish as well; I can recall SO many instances of someone dropping something and people just watching them instead of offering to help as they scramble to pick their stuff up, people don\'t hold open the elevator for someone rushing towards the door, they don\'t offer to hold a door open for someone (college aged OR elderly) carrying something heavy. In short, the residents generally had a noticeable lack of basic manners. The staff were some of the only exceptions to this which I was thankful for. I had a really lackluster experience here and I recommend looking elsewhere in West Campus for a far better living experience. You know it\'s bad when I\'m celebrating and grateful to see SUNLIGHT out of a WINDOW at my new apartment.', 'Villas on Rio has been great. It feels very safe and is great distance to campus. The building is kept clean and functional. The amenities are great and easily accessible. If there are any issues residents are informed.  Living in the pods is actually spacious and private for a better price than others in West Campus. Overall my experience has been good and I plan to renew.', 'Love Villas on Rio so far! The staff was very helpful when me and my roommate signed last year. They were willing to work with us and our preferences (even though we signed kind of late). The amenities are great and clean. I love my room! I have already resigned for next year and can’t wait to live here again.', 'Absolutely love Villas on Rio! Not only is everyone so nice, caring, and understanding, but the location is amazing. Right in the middle of West Campus commuting to and from classes is super easy. The apartment does an extremely good job of giving residents an opportunity to feel like a tight-knit community. In addition, Villas on Rio has by far the best staff. Anything from a  huge maintenance request to answering questions Villas on Rio is on it.', 'I really like this apartment! Amenities are great and I use them everyday, and being next to a Starbucks is nice. Also management is great and they’re super flexible and helpful when you have questions.

Crest at Pearl,"706 W Martin Luther King Jr Blvd, Austin, TX 78701, United States",4.0,"[""Lived here last year and I the rooms are very spacious and great for the price. The amenities are decent, they have okay gym equipment but they do not have A/C in the study room on the 3rd floor so it does get stuffy but they do have free printing service which was a huge plus. The elevators were broken regularly, sometimes for days or weeks at a time but I really think that's the only huge downside. I think the units are great as I have visited my friends in other units but I definitely would say to try to get a window room, and if you have a windowless room to get some light fixtures and some decor because it can get pretty depressing in there without a window. I think my only complaint for the unit itself would be that their appliances were a bit outdated such as the refrigerator and the washer/dryer but still functional. Lots of cabinet and pantry space in the kitchen. Somewhat dirty floors both in the unit and in general. Exceptionally helpful staff and very quick maintenance/repair team. Garage is decent and they offer a locker package retrieval service for free as well. I would definitely live here again if I got a room with a window."", 'Recently went here for some business, and had a pleasing experience. The elevator wasn’t working when I went, but I think it’s fine jogging up to the 2nd floor. However, I do understand how painful it could be to have to live in one of the higher floors when this happens. The restroom’s in the apartments are also very nice and calming; especially, William’s toilet. Overall, lovely experience, with only some minor annoyances.', 'I stopped by the office on short notice for a tour, and was able to get one immediately. Isaac was a great tour guide; friendly, welcoming, answered all of my questions, and provided me with everything I needed. Seems to be a great place to live, at an exceptional rate. Can’t wait to live here next fall!', 'Apartment is spacious for the price, but very lackluster and the entire building is just gross and musty. Bad security and very easy to get in through the gate. When we moved in the unit was disgusting, nothing had been cleaned. We even had poprocks/rock candy stuck to the inside of our cabinets upon move in. They ""inspect"" the units and charge you a small fortune for cleaning fees but then they do no cleaning whatsoever. Hallways are so ugly and dirty, there are roaches on the stairwells frequently, the elevators break all the time. Sometimes both are broken so if you live on a higher floor that\'s just tough luck.\n\nThey tried to charge me for a dirty bathroom when I hired a maid service through them that guaranteed no cleaning fees. They did credit the money back, but it shows that they just charge you for random cleaning fees regardless of what you do. There\'s no way the bathroom was dirty if I literally hired a maid service, they made that up.\n\nThe apartment is a low-quality build in general, you can hear everything through the walls which is super uncomfortable. The gym is stuffy, hot, and way too small. The treadmills also break all the time so sometimes there would only be one working and I would have to walk to a UT gym to work out. Also, something to consider: this place is right next to the 21st street co-op. They will do drum circles at odd hours of the night, my roommates and I would wake up at 4am sometimes (yes, on week nights as well as weekends) because they will randomly scream or do chants. There were some nights where we couldn\'t sleep for hours because of the noise. Not the apartment\'s fault, but the co-op being next door seriously undervalues this place and in my opinion makes it not worth what it costs to live there.\n\nOther apartments in west campus charge similar prices for better. Don\'t lease here unless you have no other option, easily the worst place I\'ve lived in west campus so far. The cherry on top for me was that when I paid my last cycle of bills (they add up 2-3 months of bills and charge you all at once at the end of summer), they charged a $19.95 processing fee for ANY form of payment. Echeck, credit card, debit card, you name it, when there was never a charge before to pay rent/bills.', 'This complex is so nice.

After the management change, the office has 0 care for my well being and is unwilling to work with you to resolve issues. I was under the impression that my unit would be furnished and requested it to be, but this wasn’t communicated as there was a change with management right when the school semester started, and I paid for a “furnished room” to get one twin mattress in my room and had to live with that for two weeks before I ordered furniture during the hectic start of the school year. In the contract they state they will replace your garage key but for a fee if lost but I they have been unable to replace it, making me have to wait outside the garage for someone to come in for the past like 3 months - such a waste of gas and time. Our dryer turns off every 5 minutes so it has to be rerun so it is like a 6 hour task to get laundry done, and the office hasn’t resolved this issue either. The only person who is pleasing to speak with is the person doing the actual repairs for maintenance (thank you Javier) and the rest of the office staff is honestly just rude and doesn’t show you the slightest respect. The property overall definitely needs some renovation as the appliances are old - the ONE elevator we have broke like every other week at one point.', 'Do not live here.

My only complaints are that my kitchen sink in my 1x1 is almost comically too small (it's a 12x12 square) and the faucet is too big for it, making it super hard to use. Also, if you have a car, the designated parking garage is poorly designed and frustrating to park at, especially considering how expensive a parking pass is.
